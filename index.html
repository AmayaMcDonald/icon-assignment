<h1>Race Disparities in Professional Sports</h1>

<h3> By Amaya McDonald – October 3, 2022 </h3>

		<p> There are major racial disparities in American professional sports, which benefit from the talents of Black athletes.

In the NFL’s 103 year history, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/nfl/how-many-nfl-teams-owned-african-americans" target="_blank">none</a> of the league’s 32 teams have ever been owned by a Black person. Among the league’s coaching staff, there are <a href="https://richmondfreepress.com/news/2022/mar/03/nfl-black-coaches-now-total-3-flores-hired-assista/" target="_blank">currently only three Black coaches</a> in the entire NFL. This representation, or lack thereof, is inconsistent with the large percentage of Black athletes that make up the <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/nfl-demographics-financials/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%2069.4%25%20of%20National,%2C%20and%20American%20Indian%200.2%25." target="_blank">majority</a> of NFL players. </p>

			<img src = "icons/goal.png" class= "picture" >The NFL established the Rooney Rule in 2003 as a policy to require league teams to interview ethnic-minority candidates for head coaching and senior football operation jobs. <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/sports/articles/2022-01-15/nfl-executives-want-expect-more-black-coaches-to-be-hired" target="_blank">Since 2003,</a> only 27 of 127 head-coaching vacancies (21%) have been filled by minorities (as of January 2021). </div>
